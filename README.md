# ATmega328P Microcontroller Development Board Prototype

This repository contains design files for a **simple prototype** of an ATmega328P microcontroller development board. **Please note**: this is a **prototype only**, and it is not intended as a final production design. It is ideal for hobbyists, students, and engineers looking to experiment and develop applications using the ATmega328P microcontroller.

## Features

The ATmega328P is an 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller that includes:
- 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities
- 1 KB EEPROM and 2 KB SRAM
- 23 general-purpose I/O lines
- Three flexible timer/counters with compare modes
- Internal and external interrupts
- Serial programmable USART
- Byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface
- SPI serial port
- 6-channel 10-bit ADC (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages)
- Programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator
- Five software-selectable power-saving modes
- Operates between 1.8V and 5.5V
- Throughput approaching 1 MIPS per MHz

## Applications

This board can be used for a variety of **prototype applications**, including:
- Robotics
- Data acquisition systems for vehicles, airplanes, and industrial automation
- Embedded systems development
- Educational and research projects

## Repository Contents

- **`atmegaboard version 1.sch`** - Schematic file for the ATmega328P development board.
- **`atmegaboard version 1.brd`** - PCB board layout for the ATmega328P.
- **`Script.docx`** - A detailed walkthrough of the design and building process.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Schematic & Board Layout**: Use any PCB design software (EAGLE, KiCad, Altium, etc.) to open the `.sch` and `.brd` files.
2. **Prototype Assembly**: Use the schematic to either build your prototype by ordering a custom PCB or manually assemble the components on a breadboard.
3. **Programming the ATmega328P**: Program the ATmega328P with a USB-to-serial converter (e.g., FTDI or CH340) using the Arduino IDE or any compatible software.
4. **Testing & Debugging**: Connect your board to your system (robotics, data acquisition, etc.), run tests, and debug your code or hardware as needed.

## Documentation

A detailed explanation of the design process is provided in the **`Script.docx`** file, including:
- Overview of the ATmega328Pâ€™s key features
- Design rationale and decisions
- How to use the board for prototyping
- Applications of the development board

## Important Notes

- This is a **prototype board**, not a final project. It is intended for testing, learning, and development purposes only.
- Please ensure you carefully test the board for your specific application.
